As I was learning React Native, I decided to give myself a project to work on to properly learn it. I never finished the project as I decided to focus more on the [website itself](https://druggedfox.pro). However, the code still stands as something I'd like to go back to and get in a completely working state.

# Technologies

This project uses Expo, React Native, and Zustand.
